# ArmadalHospital_FinanceDepartment
This was the main project of the second year. In this project, 
React JS was used as the framework for frontend development, 
and Laravel was used as the framework for backend 
development. Further phpMyAdmin was used for database 
development. I have developed the finance department section (Second-year second-semester project)
